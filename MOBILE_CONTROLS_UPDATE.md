# Mobile Controls - Update Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. **Larger Joystick** 
- **Radius**: Increased from 80px to **120px** (50% larger)
- **Inner Stick**: Increased from 35px to **50px** when active
- **Inactive Stick**: Increased from 30px to **45px**
- **Result**: Much easier to use on mobile devices with better thumb coverage

### 2. **Screen Division**
The screen is now clearly divided into two halves:

```
┌──────────────────┬──────────────────┐
│                  │                  │
│   LEFT HALF      │   RIGHT HALF     │
│   (Joystick)     │   (Look + Fire)  │
│                  │                  │
│                  │                  │
│      ◉           │                  │
│   Joystick       │      [R]  [FIRE] │
│                  │      [C]  [JUMP] │
└──────────────────┴──────────────────┘
```

**Left Half (< 50% screen width)**:
- Virtual joystick activates on any touch
- Movement controls only
- Larger hit area for better responsiveness

**Right Half (> 50% screen width)**:
- Look/rotation controls (swipe to look)
- Action buttons (FIRE, JUMP, RELOAD, CROUCH)
- All combat controls in one area

### 3. **Increased Mobile Sensitivity**
- **Mobile Look Sensitivity**: Increased from **0.3** to **0.8** (2.67x faster)
- **Desktop Sensitivity**: Remains unchanged at 0.003 (mouse)
- **Result**: Mobile players can rotate camera quickly with shorter swipes

### 4. **Better Touch Zones**
- Joystick zone expanded from 1/3 to 1/2 of screen width
- Look zone restricted to right half only (was middle 2/3)
- No overlap between joystick and look controls
- Buttons still have highest priority for collision

## Testing Instructions

### On Desktop (with M key toggle):
1. Press **M** to enable mobile mode
2. See "MOBILE MODE" indicator at bottom
3. Test joystick with mouse clicks
4. Press **M** again to return to desktop mode

### On Mobile Device:
1. Controls automatically appear
2. **Left side**: Use thumb to move joystick
3. **Right side upper area**: Swipe to look around (faster now!)
4. **Right side buttons**: Tap to shoot, jump, reload, crouch

## Key Improvements

✅ **Larger joystick** - Easier to see and use with thumbs  
✅ **Faster camera rotation** - 2.67x more responsive on mobile  
✅ **Clear screen division** - No confusion about where to touch  
✅ **Better ergonomics** - Left thumb moves, right thumb aims and shoots  
✅ **No accidental touches** - Controls don't interfere with each other  

## Technical Details

### Joystick Size
```cpp
joystickRadius = 120.0f;        // Main boundary
innerStickActive = 50.0f;       // When dragging
innerStickInactive = 45.0f;     // At rest
```

### Touch Zones
```cpp
// Joystick activation
if (touchPos.x < screenWidth / 2.0f)

// Look control activation  
if (touchPos.x > screenWidth / 2.0f)
```

### Sensitivity
```cpp
lookSensitivity = 0.8f;  // Mobile (was 0.3f)
mouseSensitivity = 0.003f;  // Desktop (unchanged)
```
